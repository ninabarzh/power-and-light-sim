# Code of Conduct

*"In Ankh-Morpork, we have learned that civilised behaviour is not optional. It is the foundation upon which everything 
else is built. The same applies here."*

## Our standards

This project exists to improve the security of critical infrastructure. That requires collaboration, and collaboration 
requires a baseline of professional conduct.

We expect participants to:

Be Professional:
- Communicate clearly and respectfully
- Focus on the technical merits of contributions
- Accept constructive criticism without taking it personally
- Provide constructive criticism without making it personal

Be Helpful:
- Answer questions when you can
- Share knowledge rather than hoarding it
- Help newcomers understand the architecture and standards
- Document your work so others can learn from it

Be Responsible:
- Use this project for legitimate security research and education
- Follow coordinated responsible disclosure for real-world vulnerabilities
- Test only systems you own or have permission to access
- Acknowledge mistakes and fix them

Be Honest
- Don't plagiarise code or research
- Credit others' work appropriately
- Disclose conflicts of interest (especially commercial relationships)
- Admit when you don't know something rather than guessing

## Unacceptable behaviour

The following behaviours will result in removal from the project:

Harassment and discrimination
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Discrimination based on identity, background, or beliefs
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions or reviews

Malicious conduct
- Using this project to harm production systems without authorisation
- Sharing exploits for active 0-days without coordinated responsible disclosure
- Deliberately introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors
- Violating the project licence for commercial gain

Unprofessional conduct
- Trolling, flame wars, or deliberately provocative behaviour
- Repeatedly submitting low-quality or untested code after feedback
- Ignoring architectural guidelines and coding standards
- Abusing the issue tracker or PR system

## Enforcement

### Reporting issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour:

1. For severe issues (harassment, threats, malicious conduct): Contact the maintainers directly at https://tymyrddin.dev/contact/
2. For code quality or technical disputes: Use the PR review process and let the maintainers make the final decision
3. For licensing violations: Report via email with evidence

All reports will be handled confidentially. You will not face retaliation for good-faith reports.

### Response process

The maintainers will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours
2. Investigate the issue (may request additional context)
3. Decide on appropriate action
4. Communicate the decision to relevant parties

### Consequences

Depending on severity, consequences may include:
- Warning: Private communication explaining the issue
- Temporary restriction: Temporary ban from contributing or commenting
- Permanent ban: Removal from the project entirely
- Legal action: For malicious conduct, licence violations, or criminal behaviour

The maintainer's decision is final. This is not a democracy; it's an infrastructure project with standards to maintain.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- Project repositories (code, issues, PRs, discussions)
- Official communication channels
- Public spaces when representing the project
- Private communication about project matters

It does not apply to:
- Personal projects or forks (unless claiming official affiliation)
- Private conversations unrelated to the project
- External security research that happens to use this simulator

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, 
with modifications to suit the specific needs of a security research project.

## Philosophy

The Patrician once noted that civilisation is maintained not through grand gestures, but through countless small 
decisions to behave properly when no one is watching. This Code of Conduct exists because we trust contributors to 
make those decisions.

If you can't treat others with basic professional respect, your technical skills are irrelevant. The goal is to 
improve security, and that requires a community where people can collaborate without dealing with nonsense.

Thank you for being part of that community.
