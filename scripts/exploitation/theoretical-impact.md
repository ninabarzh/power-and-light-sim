# Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Modbus Access to Turbine PLCs

## Technical Details

Affected Systems:
- Turbine PLCs: 192.168.10.10-12
- Manufacturer: Allen-Bradley
- Model: ControlLogix 5500
- Firmware: 20.11

Vulnerability:
Modbus TCP service (port 502) accessible from engineering network with no authentication required.

## Attack Prerequisites

Required Access:
- Network connectivity to 192.168.10.0/24
- Available via engineering workstation network (see vulnerability V-042)

Required Skills:
- Basic Modbus protocol knowledge
- Available tools: pymodbus, mbtget, any Modbus client

Required Time:
- < 5 minutes to identify vulnerable PLCs
- < 1 minute to execute commands

## Attack Scenario

1. Attacker gains access to engineering network
2. Scans for Modbus services: `nmap -p 502 192.168.10.0/24`
3. Identifies turbine PLCs responding on port 502
4. Reads current configuration to understand register mapping
5. Writes malicious values to control registers

Example Attack Command:

    from pymodbus.client import ModbusTcpClient
    client = ModbusTcpClient('192.168.10.10')
    client.connect()
    # Write zero to speed setpoint (emergency stop)
    client.write_register(1000, 0, slave=1)

## Impact analysis

### Immediate physical impact

Turbine Shutdown:
- Writing 0 to speed setpoint register causes immediate deceleration
- Turbine designed for controlled shutdown over 5-minute period
- Immediate shutdown causes mechanical stress

Safety System Response:
- Emergency stop systems would activate
- Backup generator would engage (30-second delay)
- Critical loads would experience brief power loss

### Operational impact

Production loss:
- Each turbine generates 15MW
- Current electricity price: €85/MWh
- Loss per turbine per hour: €1,275
- Three turbines down: €3,825/hour

Recovery time:
- Turbine restart procedure: 2 hours minimum
- Safety system reset: 30 minutes
- System checks required: 1 hour
- Total downtime: ~3.5 hours minimum

Financial impact (single attack):
- Production loss: €13,387.50
- Maintenance inspection: €5,000 (stress damage check)
- Emergency response: €2,000
- Total: ~€20,400

### Safety Impact

Potential Risks:
- Sudden speed change increases bearing stress
- Repeated attacks could cause premature bearing failure
- Bearing failure on rotating machinery is a serious safety risk
- Personnel typically present in turbine hall during operations

Mitigation (Current):
- Physical emergency stops available
- Operators can manually override PLC commands
- Safety systems independent of Modbus control

Risk Level:
Medium: Attack would be noticed quickly, operators can intervene, but repeated attacks could cause cumulative damage

### Worst-Case Scenario

If an attacker modified turbine parameters subtly rather than shutting down completely:

- Gradual overspeed (e.g., 1510 RPM instead of 1500)
- Below alarm threshold (1550 RPM)
- Causes accelerated wear
- Could lead to catastrophic failure weeks later
- Failure of spinning turbine could send shrapnel through turbine hall

This worst-case scenario has much higher safety risk but would be harder to detect

### Evidence

Network Access Confirmed:
- Successfully connected to 192.168.10.10:502 from engineering workstation
- Modbus service responded to query commands
- Successfully read holding registers (read-only test)

Attack Feasibility:
- PoC script developed and tested against simulator
- Simulator exhibited expected behaviour (speed changed as commanded)
- No technical barriers to production attack
- Only ethical constraints prevented production test

### Recommendations

Immediate (< 1 week):
1. Implement network ACLs to restrict Modbus access
2. Monitor Modbus traffic for unexpected write commands
3. Document baseline of legitimate Modbus operations

Short-term (< 1 month):
1. Deploy Modbus firewall with write command filtering
2. Implement role-based access for Modbus operations
3. Add alerting for write operations to critical registers

Long-term (< 6 months):
1. Migrate to authenticated protocol (Modbus/TCP Security)
2. Implement proper network segmentation (separate control VLANs)
3. Deploy IDS with OT protocol awareness
