# Exploitation scripts

**Phase:** Active attack demonstrations
**Risk Level:** HIGH (modifies device state, may cause unsafe conditions)
**Goal:** Demonstrate security vulnerabilities and potential impact

## WARNING
These scripts actively manipulate ICS devices. In real environments:
- Could cause physical damage
- May trigger safety systems
- Likely illegal without authorization
- Should NEVER be used on production systems

Only run against the simulator for PoC/testing purposes.

## Scripts

### Turbine attacks
- **turbine_overspeed_attack.py** - Force turbine beyond safe speed limits
- **turbine_emergency_stop.py** - Trigger emergency shutdown
- **modbus_shutdown_attack_demo.py** - Demonstrate shutdown attack vector

### Data exfiltration
- **historian_exfiltration.py** - Steal historical operational data
- **covert_exfiltration.py** - Exfiltrate data while evading detection

### PLC analysis/manipulation
- **plc_logic_extraction.py** - Extract PLC ladder logic
- **ladder-logic-analysis.py** - Analyze extracted ladder logic
- **modbus_turbine_simulator.py** - Simulate turbine behavior for testing

### Detection evasion
- **protocol_camouflage.py** - Disguise malicious traffic as legitimate
- **anomaly_bypass_test.py** - Test anomaly detection bypasses
- **logging_gap_test.py** - Identify logging blind spots
- **ids_detection_test.py** - Test IDS detection capabilities
- **siem_correlation_test.py** - Test SIEM correlation rules

## Attack kill chain

1. **Recon** → Identify targets
2. **Discovery** → Map control points
3. **Access** → Establish connection
4. **Exploitation** → Execute attack
5. **Impact** → Achieve objective (overspeed, shutdown, etc.)
6. **Evasion** → Avoid detection

## Responsible disclosure

If these PoCs reveal real vulnerabilities:
- Document thoroughly
- Report to vendor/CERT
- Do not publish details until patched
- Follow coordinated disclosure timelines

## Status

All scripts need validation against current simulator:
- Update for Celsius temperatures
- Test against protocol servers
- Verify safety system responses
- Document actual vs expected impact
